### Debian-based distros

A debian package is provided so debian-based distro users don't need to download
the dependencies themselves. All they have to do is download the .deb package
and install it using apt-get (or apt).

```sh
sudo apt install ./progress-tracker-1.2.deb
```

After that, the system should have updated the desktop database and the
application will appear in the app menu to be started from there.

want to download the source code and build it yourself.
